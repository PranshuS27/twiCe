# twiCe
My programming language, written in Java.

Did not make me TT, in fact I CHEERed UP. It's not really Like Ooh Aah though :(

Named twiCe after a very good kpop group :^)

I used a tree walk interpreter, and created a repl for it too. Or you could just use a file if you want but that's not tested

Some stuff it does ![image](https://github.com/PranshuS27/twiCe/assets/139021165/750cb066-ad57-43f8-b082-92f604612a6f)

Potential changes: Try to write in C so that it runs better, maybe boostrap it
