# twiCe

## Intro 
My programming language, written in Java.

Did not make me TT, in fact I CHEERed UP. It's not really Like Ooh Aah though :(

Named twiCe after a very good kpop group :^)

## Credits 
Robert Nystorm's book https://craftinginterpreters.com/a-map-of-the-territory.html was very helpful, I followed the general layout that he gave, I did try to write most of it myself, and implemented some of the challenges (planning to do the others later)

## Technical Stuff

I used a tree walk interpreter, and created a repl for it too. Or you could just use a file if you want but that's not tested

Some stuff it does ![image](https://github.com/PranshuS27/twiCe/assets/139021165/750cb066-ad57-43f8-b082-92f604612a6f)

## TO DO

Try to rewrite in C so that it runs better and just add more features overall
