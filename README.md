# twiCe

## Intro 
I called it twiCe because this is the second time I've tried this (and also I like the band). Pretty simple and basic but effective.

## Technical Stuff

I used a tree walk interpreter, and created a repl for it too. Or you could just use a file if you want but that's not tested.  Currently supports object orientation and inheritance.

Some stuff it does ![image](https://github.com/PranshuS27/twiCe/assets/139021165/750cb066-ad57-43f8-b082-92f604612a6f)

## TO DO

Try to rewrite in C so that it runs better and just add more features overall
